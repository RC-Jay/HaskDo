# Haskdo
*-- control your life.*

Haskdo is a tool which helps you keep track of your time. All you have to do is just log your day in a Google Keep note.

Whenever you* run the program, your data gets synced, safely archived, and is processed to create a report detailing the total time spent in absolute and percentage terms.

Haskdo treats a day as a list of atomic events -- which have certain attributes. This makes it easier to filter your analysis however you prefer.

Haskdo offers a swathe of categories you can tag your event with. Currently, we offer only one category per event. We're working on increasing it.

\* This will be made automatic soon.
